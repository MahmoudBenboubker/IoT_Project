Geo-tracking project by : 
* Mahmoud Benboubker  
* Nicolas Calligaro  
* AÃ¯cha Lalhou  

**Main Goal** :  Predict, as accurately as possible, the most precise location of a device using Machine Learning models

* Use of the Leaflet library for dynamic map representation
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset using Seaborn and Matplotlib.pyplot
* Preprocessing data using Numpy and Pandas
* Training and Evaluating Regression Models (Sklearn and Xgboost)
